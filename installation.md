# Installation

To install an AcaciaLinux system, you have 2 possibilities:

- Hosted install
- Standalone install

## [Hosted install](/installation/hosted_install.md)
The hosted install assumes you already have a running Linux system and uses that system as  a launchpad for your new AcaciaLinux installation.

## [Standalone install](/installation/standalone_install.md)
This approach uses the installation ISO to install AcaciaLinux from the live environment.

## [Disk setup](/installation/disk_setup.md)
