# Standalone install

To do a standalone install, you will need an AcaciaLinux ISO image, available from the [Downloads](https://acacialinux.org/downloads) section on the [acacialinux.org](https://acacialinux.org) page. When possible it is recommended to use the latest release for the best user experience.

Once you obtained a copy of the ISO, you can boot it from your preferred media.

> **Note**
>
> Currently it is not possible to perform a standalone installation of AcaciaLinux, this it is recommended to use the route of the [hosted installation](/installation/hosted_install.md)
