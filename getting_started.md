# Getting Started with Acacia Linux
Welcome to Acacia Linux, a distribution designed for intermediate and expert Linux users who seek a highly customizable and performant operating system. As you embark on your journey with Acacia Linux, this "Getting started" guide will provide you with essential information to set up and utilize the distribution effectively.

## Target Audience
Acacia Linux caters to intermediate and expert Linux users. While it aspires to include beginners in the future, the current setup requires a certain level of knowledge to get started.

## Primary Goal
The primary goal of Acacia Linux is to provide users with a blank canvas for customization and optimal performance. Unlike traditional distributions, Acacia Linux is delivered completely bare, empowering users to install only the packages they need. Additionally, Acacia Linux aims to simplify the process of building and redistributing packages through its website and community-founded build-bots.

## Desktop Environment
By default, Acacia Linux does not come with a desktop environment. However, users can easily install the GNOME desktop environment if desired. There is also a [dedicated ISO](https://acacialinux.org/downloads) that comes pre-installed with GNOME.

## Editions and Flavors
Acacia Linux is available in multiple editions to suit different preferences:

- Acacia Core: A minimal ISO image.
- Acacia Core with firmware: Core edition with essential firmware included.
- Acacia Desktop: Core edition with a desktop environment (GNOME can be installed separately).
- Desktop with firmware: Desktop edition with essential firmware included.

## System Requirements
While the minimum requirements have not been extensively tested, a system with approximately 2GB of RAM and 20GB of storage space should suffice to run Acacia Linux.

## Download
Acacia Linux can be downloaded from the official website at [https://acacialinux.org/downloads](https://acacialinux.org/downloads). Direct downloads are available from this page.

## Live Environment
Currently, Acacia Linux does not offer a Live CD/DVD/USB environment for testing before installation. However, users can install Acacia Linux to a virtual machine for testing purposes.

## Installation Options
The current installation process requires the entire system space, preventing dual-boot configurations. The installation process is a work in progress and will likely improve over time. Advanced users may have the flexibility to tweak the setup as needed.

## Open-Source Nature
Acacia Linux is committed to being entirely open-source, aligning with the principles of the Linux community.

## Customization and Uniqueness
One of Acacia Linux's standout features is its blank slate approach, akin to Arch Linux, allowing users to tailor their system to their specific needs and preferences. The Acacia Linux website provides a visually appealing platform where users can observe packages being built and even participate in building their own packages if desired.

## Update Schedule
Acacia Linux does not follow a fixed release schedule due to its nature as a hobby project run by volunteers. Updates are released as time permits, with the aim of keeping the distribution as up-to-date as possible.

## Package Management
Acacia Linux employs its own package manager called ["leaf"](https://github.com/AcaciaLinux/leaf) to handle installations and dependencies.

## Software Repository
The official Acacia Linux website offers a comprehensive repository of installable packages, accessible at [https://acacialinux.org/packages](https://acacialinux.org/packages).

## Community Support
Acacia Linux maintains an active presence on [GitHub](https://github.com/AcaciaLinux), where users can freely open issues, start discussions, and seek help. As a volunteer-driven project, response times may vary, and your patience is appreciated.

## Known Limitations
As Acacia Linux is still in its early stages of development, the number of available packages for installation may be limited. If your desired package is not listed, you can request it by opening an issue on the GitHub repository.

Thank you for choosing Acacia Linux as your operating system. We hope this guide helps you get started and enjoy the journey of customizing and optimizing your Linux experience. Happy computing!
